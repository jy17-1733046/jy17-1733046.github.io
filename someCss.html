        <p style="font-family:'Gill Sans', 'Gill Sans MT', Calibri, 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif">My favorite animal is the elephant because they're really big but gentle. I've really wanted to ride an elephant since I was little. They also have really long noses, which makes it entertaining to watch them eat. I also like how they hold each other's tails when they walk in heards. It is really cute!</p>

        <p style= "font-family:'Lucida Sans', 'Lucida Sans Regular', 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif"> One of my favorite drinks are bubble tea. I really like Thai Milk Tea and Passionfruit Green Tea. A big part of the reason why I really like Boba is because it reminds me of my childhood, where I went to get boba with my family all the time after getting dim sum with my grandparents. </p>
